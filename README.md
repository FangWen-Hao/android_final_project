# Android Final Project  : Silencing my app.

## About
‘Silencing Your Phone’ is an app that can automatically make your phone silent or vibrate when you are near a place you previously pinned.

## Why Developing it?
Sometimes when we go to some quiet places such as hospital, church, etc. we can forget to our phones to silent or vibrate and eventually end up disturbing others.
